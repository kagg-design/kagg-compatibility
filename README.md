# KAGG Compatibility

The plugin blocks PHP 8.1 deprecation messages from WordPress core, WooCommerce, Jetpack and other plugins.

[WordPress is not fully compatible with PHP 8.0 or 8.1](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/10/wordpress-5-9-and-php-8-0-8-1/). All remaining known PHP 8.1 issues are deprecation notices.

The same is related to many popular plugins such as WooCommerce, Jetpack and others. Mainly, they produce deprecation notices from the Action Scheduler library.

## Features

* Plugin blocks all deprecation notices from WordPress core, WooCommerce, JetPack and many others using Action Scheduler library.
* Plugin filters out errors from these libraries only. Errors produced by the user code are not blocked, which helps to debug.
* During activation, plugin installs a mu-plugin `kagg-compatibility-error-handler.php` into the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` folder. It contains the error handler, which loads earlier than any plugin or theme.
