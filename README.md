# KAGG Compatibility

The plugin blocks error messages of any level from WordPress core, plugins, and themes.

[WordPress is not fully compatible with PHP 8.0 - 8.3](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/php-compatibility-and-wordpress-versions/). Remaining known PHP 8.0+ issues are deprecation notices.

The same is related to many popular plugins such as WooCommerce, Jetpack, Gravity Forms and others. Mainly, they produce deprecation notices from the Action Scheduler library.

## Features

* The plugin blocks deprecation notices, user deprecation notices, notices, warnings, user notices, and user warnings.
* The list of folders from which errors are blocked can be filtered. This list may specify any WordPress Core, plugin and theme folders.
* Plugin filters out errors from these folders only. Errors produced by other code are not blocked, which helps in debugging user code.
* During activation, plugin installs a mu-plugin `kagg-compatibility-error-handler.php` into the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` folder. It contains the error handler, which loads earlier than any plugin or theme.
